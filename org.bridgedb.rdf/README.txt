org.bridgedb.rdf
---------------------

Still heavily under development!

Purpose:
1. Provide a tool for saving DataSource information in a RDF format.
2. Tool for creating DataSources by reading the RDF format

3. Extra Support for DataSource to UriPattern mapping
    To replace hack in ops.bridgebd.ops.sql (to be renamed ops.bridgedb.uri.sql)

3a. To be determined if Uri -> Xref -> Uri should be SQL query based or HashMap based
  i. Dettermining factor is speed on a large machine

Similar to ops.bridgedb.bio with the plan to convert all data from ops.bridgedb.bio 
   into ../org.bridgedb.utils/resources/BioDataSource.ttl
Including future updates to datasources.txt (until BioDataSource.ttl becomes default for all projects (if ever))
