This package is still under development and likely to change without notice.
<p>
    The reasons this is implemented stand alone rather than in the SimpleGdb are:
    <ol>
        <li>This implementation is designed for speed not size</li>
            <ul>
                <li>All mappings are full mappings not half mappings</li>
                <li>Columns sizes for exapmple DataSource sysCode may be wider.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>This implementation will support different type of mapping (different mapping predicates).</li>
        <li>This implementation will support provenance.</li>
        <li>There are currently no plans to support AttributeMapper.</li>
        <li>Derby will not be hard wired in as a default option.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    We do plan on respecting the info table with schemaversion.
    Older versions will be handled by calling simpleGdbFactory
    Schemaversion number MUST be corrinated between "SQL" and "SimbpleGdb2 versions.
