The `.tsv` files are just copies of the `.txt` files in this directory, with headers added. The `.txt` files currently are the single-source of truth. The only purpose at the moment for the `.tsv` files is to take advantage of GitHub's pretty-print formatting.

The file `datasources_headers.txt` gives column headers and brief descriptions
for `datasources.txt`. The term `conventional`, as found in
`datasources_headers.txt`, refers to established usage norms for the BridgeDb
project.
`<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#about>` refers to the identifier we
are using for the concept. The identifier is in the form of a URL (IRI).
